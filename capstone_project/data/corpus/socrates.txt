Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher who lived in Athens during the 5th century BCE.
He is considered one of the founders of Western philosophy.
Socrates is best known for the Socratic method, a form of inquiry that involves asking
a series of probing questions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas.
He did not write any texts himself; his ideas are known through the works of his students,
especially Plato and Xenophon.
